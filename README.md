In this project, I:<br>
- Collaborated with the development team to create an AI-powered software system for managing and tracking logistics and distribution operations, responsible for designing and implementing the Customer Service Center module.
- Innovatively integrated a "Knowledge-Based Q&A System" into the Customer Service Center module trained by NLP, enabling the creation of an intelligent chatbot that operates while safeguarding company privacy.
- Employed Vue3 and Bootstrap component library with Streamlit to design user-friendly interfaces that enhanced user experience, meanwhile establishing a robust proxy between frontend and backend using Nginx to improve system stability and responsiveness.
- Integrated Flink into Spring Boot using a thread pool for non-blocking operation and used it for processing message stream data, Neo4j for recommendation data, and JSoup for web scraping.
